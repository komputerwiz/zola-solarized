# Solarized Zola Theme

A simple [Zola](https://getzola.org/) theme based on the [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color palette by Ethan Schoonover.
This theme makes use of the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) UI library and has simple widgets for allowing the user to select light/dark mode and preferred font.

This theme is based on my [Solarized Hugo theme](https://github.com/komputerwiz/hugo-solarized).

The included fonts are three of my favorite monospace coding fonts:

- [Ubuntu Mono](https://design.ubuntu.com/font)
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
- [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/)

Feel free to fork this repository (or copy the theme files into your own project) and modify to your liking if you want to use different fonts or styles.

There is also baked-in support for site search using [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/).

This theme has been a work-in-progress for a long time, but I consider it mostly stable at this point and has not had any major revisions for a while.

Originally, I designed this theme for organizing minutes and information for my local [amateur radio club](https://w5bcs.radio/). It is intended to work well both on screen and in print media at various zoom levels. I liked the design and wanted to use it in some of my other Hugo projects, so I extracted the basic layout components into a standalone theme. I figured others might like it as well. Enjoy!
